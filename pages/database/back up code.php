                          <p>The Group stated that hunting of wild pigs has decreased since last quarter but this

                          was no change in the number of people involved in hunting wild pigs since last quarter,
                          only normal seasonal changes. However, the number of wild pigs is still below what it
                          was in previous years. The barangay has therefore recently decided to establish a
                          closed season for hunting in December and January. Blasting of wild pigs is practised,
                          particularly in the fields, in order to prevent pigs eating the rice. There was a short
                          discussion of blasting around how to solve the fact that blasting is illegal according to
                          the law but considered important for the protection of the rice harvest. No solution
                          was found but the discussion will continue.

                          There are still very many traps. The Group discussed the need to limit the number of
                          traps; no agreement was reached within the Group but all agreed that over-hunting was
                          taking place. One of the Group members gave the example that it took 4 days to catch
                          one pig with 3 traps in the vicinity of lower Blos River.

                          <p>The Group stated that hunting of wild pigs has decreased since last quarter but this
                          was attributed to seasonal changes and not to a decrease in the pig population. There
                          was no change in the number of people involved in hunting wild pigs since last quarter,
                          only normal seasonal changes. However, the number of wild pigs is still below what it
                          was in previous years. The barangay has therefore recently decided to establish a
                          closed season for hunting in December and January. Blasting of wild pigs is practised,
                          particularly in the fields, in order to prevent pigs eating the rice. There was a short
                          discussion of blasting around how to solve the fact that blasting is illegal according to
                          the law but considered important for the protection of the rice harvest. No solution
                          was found but the discussion will continue.

                          There are still very many traps. The Group discussed the need to limit the number of
                          traps; no agreement was reached within the Group but all agreed that over-hunting was
                          taking place. One of the Group members gave the example that it took 4 days to catch
                          one pig with 3 traps in the vicinity of lower Blos River.

                          <p>The Group stated that hunting of wild pigs has decreased since last quarter but this
                          was attributed to seasonal changes and not to a decrease in the pig population. There
                          was no change in the number of people involved in hunting wild pigs since last quarter,
                          only normal seasonal changes. However, the number of wild pigs is still below what it
                          was in previous years. The barangay has therefore recently decided to establish a
                          closed season for hunting in December and January. Blasting of wild pigs is practised,
                          particularly in the fields, in order to prevent pigs eating the rice. There was a short
                          discussion of blasting around how to solve the fact that blasting is illegal according to
                          the law but considered important for the protection of the rice harvest. No solution
                          was found but the discussion will continue.
                          <br><br>
                          There are still very many traps. The Group discussed the need to limit the number of
                          traps; no agreement was reached within the Group but all agreed that over-hunting was
                          taking place. One of the Group members gave the example that it took 4 days to catch
                          one pig with 3 traps in the vicinity of lower Blos River.
                          <br><br>
                          All pigs are reported to have been consumed within the Barangay, with some of the pigs
                          being sold to other barangay members (should be continued with results on the other
                          resource uses, hunting of wild deer, catch of freshwater fish, use of household timber,
                          catch of lobster).</p>
