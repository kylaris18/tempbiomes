                            <p>The Group stated that hunting of wild pigs has decreased since last quarter but this
                            was attributed to seasonal changes and not to a decrease in the pig population. There
                            was no change in the number of people involved in hunting wild pigs since last quarter,
                            only normal seasonal changes. However, the number of wild pigs is still below what it
                            was in previous years. The barangay has therefore recently decided to establish a
                            closed season for hunting in December and January. Blasting of wild pigs is practised,
                            particularly in the fields, in order to prevent pigs eating the rice. There was a short
                            discussion of blasting around how to solve the fact that blasting is illegal according to
                            the law but considered important for the protection of the rice harvest. No solution
                            was found but the discussion will continue.

                            There are still very many traps. The Group discussed the need to limit the number of
                            traps; no agreement was reached within the Group but all agreed that over-hunting was
                            taking place. One of the Group members gave the example that it took 4 days to catch
                            one pig with 3 traps in the vicinity of lower Blos River.

                            <p>The Group stated that hunting of wild pigs has decreased since last quarter but this
                            was attributed to seasonal changes and not to a decrease in the pig population. There
                            was no change in the number of people involved in hunting wild pigs since last quarter,
                            only normal seasonal changes. However, the number of wild pigs is still below what it
                            was in previous years. The barangay has therefore recently decided to establish a
                            closed season for hunting in December and January. Blasting of wild pigs is practised,
                            particularly in the fields, in order to prevent pigs eating the rice. There was a short
                            discussion of blasting around how to solve the fact that blasting is illegal according to
                            the law but considered important for the protection of the rice harvest. No solution
                            was found but the discussion will continue.
                            <br><br>
                            There are still very many traps. The Group discussed the need to limit the number of
                            traps; no agreement was reached within the Group but all agreed that over-hunting was
                            taking place. One of the Group members gave the example that it took 4 days to catch
                            one pig with 3 traps in the vicinity of lower Blos River.
